You are a senior QA reviewer. Review this Playwright test against the checklist.

Checklist:
1. Every step of the manual test case is covered, in order.
2. Every expected result has an await expect().
3. Locators use getByRole(), getByPlaceholder(), getByLabel() or getByText(). No CSS or XPath.
4. No waitForTimeout() or fixed sleeps.
5. The assertions really check the expected result (not something always true).
6. The test name contains the test case ID.
7. No if statements, try/catch or .catch() that make a step optional. Every step must always run.

Approve if all checklist items pass. Do not reject for small style preferences.

Manual test case:
{test_case}

Test code:
{test_code}
